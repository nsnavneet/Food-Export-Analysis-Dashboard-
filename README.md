# Food Export Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
The Food Export Analysis Dashboard is an interactive tool designed to analyze food export data and identify trends and areas for improvement in export processes. It provides visualizations and interactive elements to facilitate data exploration and decision-making.

## Functionality
### Data Visualization:
- **Charts:**
  - Bar chart: Displays rejection rates by country of origin.
  - Pie chart (optional): Shows the overall distribution of food product rejections.
- **PivotTable:** Summarizes rejection counts by risk category and notification details.

### Interactive Elements:
- **Slicers:** Allow users to filter data by specific risk categories or countries of origin.
- **Conditional Formatting:** Highlights countries with high rejection rates (red) and low rejection rates (green) for quick identification of problem areas.

## Data Description
The dashboard is designed to work with the following data:

- **Risk Category:** Classification of the rejection reason (e.g., not serious, serious, undecided).
- **Count of Food Rejections:** The number of rejections for each category.
- **Notified By:** The party who notified about the rejection.
- **Country of Origin:** The country where the food originated.
- **Product Category:** The type of food product that was rejected.
- **Action Taken:** The actions taken in response to the rejection.
- **(Optional) Date of Rejection:** The date the rejection occurred.

## Using the Dashboard
1. Open the dashboard file (Food_Export_Analysis_Dashboard.xlsx).
2. Use the slicers on the left side of the dashboard to filter the data by risk category or country of origin (if present).
3. View the charts and PivotTable to explore rejection rates by country, risk category, and other relevant factors.
4. The conditional formatting (if present) will highlight countries with high rejection rates in red for easy identification.

## Additional Notes
- This dashboard serves as a starting point for further analysis. Customize the charts, slicers, and pivot tables to suit specific needs.
- Pivot tables allow users to drill down into the data for further exploration (e.g., clicking on a specific country in the pivot table might show a breakdown of rejection counts by product category).
